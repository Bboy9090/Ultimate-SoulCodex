# Railway Deployment Guide

## Cost: **$5 FREE CREDIT/month** - Good for small 24/7 apps

Railway offers a simple deployment experience:
- **$5 free credit** per month (no credit card for first month)
- **Always on** - no spin-down
- **Usage-based pricing** after free credit
- **One-click PostgreSQL**
- **GitHub auto-deploy**

## Free Credit Breakdown

With $5 free credit/month, you can run:
- **~500 hours** of small app runtime (sufficient for 24/7)
- **Small PostgreSQL database** (~1GB)
- **5GB bandwidth**

**Typical usage for Soul Codex:** ~$3-7/month depending on traffic

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Have credit card ready (required after first month)

## Deployment Steps

**To disable auto-deploy:**
- Go to service settings
- Toggle off "Auto Deploy"

## Custom Domain Setup

1. Click on service → "Settings" → "Domains"
2. Click "Custom Domain"
3. Enter your domain
4. Add CNAME record to your DNS:
   ```
   CNAME: yourdomain.com → your-app.up.railway.app
   ```
5. SSL certificate is automatically provisioned

## Webhooks Setup

### Stripe Webhook URL
```
https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/stripe/webhook
```

## Scaling

### Vertical Scaling (More Resources)
Railway automatically scales based on usage. You can set limits:
- Go to "Settings" → "Resources"
- Set memory and CPU limits

### Horizontal Scaling (More Instances)
- Available on Pro plan
- Can run multiple replicas
- Automatic load balancing

## Database Management

### Connect to PostgreSQL
```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway connect postgres

# Or get connection string
railway variables
# Look for DATABASE_URL
```

### Backup Database
```bash
# Manual backup
railway run pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql

# Restore
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
```

### Database Limits
- **Free tier:** Limited by $5 credit (typically 1-2GB)
- **Usage-based:** $0.50/GB/month

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --build

# Redeploy
railway up
```

### App Crashes
```bash
# View runtime logs
railway logs

# Check variables
railway variables

# Restart
railway restart
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Check database status
railway status

# Test connection
railway run node -e "import('pg').then(({ Pool }) => { const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }); pool.query('SELECT NOW()').then(r => console.log(r.rows)).finally(() => pool.end()); });"
```

### Cost Overruns
1. Check metrics dashboard
2. Set resource limits
3. Optimize app (reduce memory, CPU)
4. Consider cheaper alternatives if consistently over budget

## Environment Migration

### From Development to Production
```bash
# Export variables from one env
railway variables --environment production

# Import to another
# (manually set in dashboard)
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Secrets Management**
   - Use Railway's environment variables (encrypted)
   - Never commit secrets to repo

2. **2FA**
   - Enable 2FA on Railway account

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit team member permissions
   - Use GitHub deploy keys

4. **Monitoring**
   - Enable log retention
   - Set up alerts for errors

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Optimize Memory Usage**
   - Node.js apps can be memory-intensive
   - Use `--max-old-space-size=512` flag to limit

2. **Reduce Bandwidth**
   - Enable compression
   - Use CDN for static assets (Cloudflare)

3. **Database Optimization**
   - Regular VACUUM
   - Index optimization
   - Clean up old data

4. **Sleep Unused Services**
   - If not needed 24/7, use Render instead (free with spin-down)
